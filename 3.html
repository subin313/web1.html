  <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as
      JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
      prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.Alon
      gside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of
      the core technologies of the World Wide
      Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[11] often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
      As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript support
      event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
      The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
      JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.
